'''
This pygame project will work with my web scrapping graph
used to find the temperatures for the next 24 hours
Weather data used courtesy to  National Weather Service Forecast Office
https://www.weather.gov/okx/
I will provide my matplotlib graph as an image that I have saved
into this pygame project
