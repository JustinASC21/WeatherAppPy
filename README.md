# WeatherAppPy
A simple Weather App, which is interactive and uses image files as background images which need to be downloaded. This Weather App uses parsing to grab the data from The National Weather Service Forecast Office and displays it to the user with matplotlib in a graph.


Right Below is the default window that the user will be presented with.

Once you click on the button "Check Temp", you will be presented with a dialogue prompt to check how many hours in advance to check the temperatures for.

When you click on the "Back" button you can try again and check the temperatures for different ranges of hours.
(All data from The National Weather Service Forecast Office is retrieved every hour, and this program will not be overloading requests the the website.)
